# Smart Contract

### 1. Definition
  - On Ethereum, smart contract is a software which is stored, deployed, executed by blockchain network
  - The most common case of smart contract is **Ethereum**'s smart contract, including dApps, ERC20 Tokens, and even ICO fundraisings
  - Note : smart contract is not a contract, not a smart AI-one, not even a contract which is smart. It's just an software

### 2. Examples
  - Currently, **Solidity** is most common ethereum smart contract language, which includes Solidity Compiler.
  - Alternatively, **Vyper** : Python-scripting based smart contract scripting language is currently in dev progress.
  - But, Vyper is a lot more complicated than solidity, even in beta-progress.
